20 Days?. Buckle up. Start learning in context meanings from princeton review's 13 groups in supplementary material. If you are done, then continue with 800 High frequency list from barron's (available on Quizlet). Practice math from 5lb manhattan book. Read Essays from AWA pool on ETS website.(Analyze an Issue, Analyze an Argument). Write PowerPrep 1 today and see the areas which are causing you troubles and improve them. Before 5 days from exam write PowerPrep 2, see things which you are still struggling with and practice them again. Before test day take rest and on test day stay calm. All the best for your Exam.
EDIT 1:
The more structured your prep is going to be the easier it'll be to continue with prep, since you are aiming this within a 20 day time slot.
Example: 
Set 2 Hours in the morning to cram all the vocab.
Take a set questions from any vocab site and see how well you have improved over past day, this will instill more confidence on moving forward with your strategy.
Practice quant questions(I personally suggest you to start with practicing questions and then follow up on topics which you didn't fare well).
Take a set of questions from any quant site and try finshing them within the stipulated time.
Revise the vocab you have learned so far in your entire prep (This might take longer in initial stages, but after few days you'll have the power to answer all the 1500+ vocab words within under an hour. This helps in answering question in vocab section quickly and spend that time on answering tougher questions.)
